# Album-collection-SQL-Project

### As a part of our semester-1 coursework, we had a module titled "Database in Practice," where we worked on an SQL project by considering the relational database schema “album_collection_schema” provided by the module leader. The project involved utilizing advanced SQL concepts to cover various topics, such as creating customized views to display data, implementing triggers to automate database actions, and designing stored procedures and functions to facilitate interaction with databases. We have shared code snippets & outputs of the project here. Also, we utilized MySQL Workbench for this project and are thrilled to share our work with you, hoping that you find it informative and engaging.

#### Note ‒ DML statements typically provide output data, but it can be challenging to display output from DDL statements as they do not return data. We have attempted to include output snippets of relevant codes (post-creation) to demonstrate the possible outcomes.
